# Domains listed as virtual_alias_domains can be used for forwarding
# ("aliasing") email from an email address to another email address (or multiple
# addresses). virtual_alias_domains do not receive email for users. They
# only forward mail somewhere else.
#
# The virtual_alias_maps mapping contains forwardings (source, destination) of
# users or domains to other email addresses or whole domains.
# Incidentally virtual_alias_maps also works for local email addresses, too.
# So you do not really need virtual_alias_domains as you can declare all
# domains as virtual mailbox domains and use virtual alias maps for aliases.
#
# valid placeholders are:
#   %s = full search string (email address)
#   %u = user part only, without @
#   %d = domain part only, without @
#
# The SQL query template as of postfix 2.2 and later
# skema: SELECT `destination` FROM `aliases` WHERE (`email` = '%s')
#
