# The relay_recipient_maps parameter specifies optional lookup tables with all
# addresses in the domains that match $relay_domains.
#
# If this parameter is defined, then the SMTP server will reject mail for
# unknown relay users. This feature is off by default.
#
# The right-hand side of the lookup tables is conveniently ignored.
# In the left-hand side, specify an @domain.tld wildcard, or specify
# a user@domain.tld address.

# This file folds a complete list of email address for which the email gateway
# will accept mail. Even though you have to enter the values as a pair
# (key & value), the second part (the value) doesn't actually matter as long
# as the email address is correct.
